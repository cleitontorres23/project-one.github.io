        <p>Load balancer in Layer 4 and Layer 7</p>
<p>This is the first of series of knowledge tops about technologies and stuffs. I hope you enjoy the journey.</p>
<p>In technology, a load balancer distributes connections from clients between a set of servers . A server load balancing (SLB)is designed for pools of application servers within a single site or local area network (LAN)</p>
<p>one of the most important difference between Network layer and application layer is the algorithms in how they’re able to analyze incoming traffic.</p>
<p>Examples of network layer algorithms include: Round robin, Weighted round robin , Least connections, Weighted least connections , Source IP hash (we can talk about it later)</p>
<p>What is LAYER 4
Based on traffic routing, such as IP address and destination ports . Considering layer 4 (TCP) and below.
Caring only about the network-layer information  contained within the packets it is directing this way and that</p>
<p>What is LAYER 7
Based on network traffic and HTTP protocol , from the network layer to the application layer.
Provides the ability to route HTTP and HTTPS traffic based upon rules.</p>
<p>Long story short..
Application Load Balancer works at the Application Layer (Layer 7 of the OSI model) and the network load balancer works at layers 3 &amp; 4 (network and transport layers).</p>
<p>Is different, period.</p>
<p>Another difference between the two is important because network load balancing cannot assure availability of the application, in other words, it can just correctly complete the three-way TCP handshake and an application load balancer goes much deeper, is capable of determining availability based on successful HTTP GET of a particular page.</p>
